## HTML Code


## CSS Code

•`body`: This sets some basic styles for the entire page, including setting the margin and padding to 0 and centering the content both horizontally and vertically using the flex display property.

•`.infinite`: This is the main container element for the infinite road animation. It is given a fixed width and height, and a dark grey background color. The transform property is used to give it a 3D perspective and rotate it slightly.

•`.infinite:before`: This is a pseudo-element that is positioned on top of the .infinite container. It creates the illusion of an endless road by using a linear gradient that is animated using the @keyframes rule to create a moving pattern.

•`.infinite:after`: This is another pseudo-element that creates a shadow effect at the bottom of the infinite road animation.

•`.shadow`: This is a separate element that creates a transparent gradient effect at the bottom of the infinite road animation to give the appearance of a shadow.
